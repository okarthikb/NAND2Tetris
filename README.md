# nand2tetris
This repo contains my solutions to problems in the nand2tetris course. The book "Elements of Computing Systems - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" has 12 chapters, and each chapter has a project. The [Nand to Tetris website](https://nand2tetris.org) has all the skeletal files and required software suite.
